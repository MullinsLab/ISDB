Updates an existing GFF-per-gene export directory.  Updated files will be
updated, files which didn't change won't be touched, and files which would no
longer exist are deleted.

This is done by running export-gff-per-gene on a temporary directory and then
running rsync (in checksum mode) to synchronize the changes.
