#
# This script scans an input stream of JSON records and identifies plausible
# sets of integration sites reported from complementary proviral LTRs.  The
# "best" site from each such set (or clump) is output while the rest are
# discarded.  The goal is to filter out evidence that is plausibly from
# opposite ends of the same provirus in order to be conservative and reduce
# double-counting.
#
# An outline of the process:
#
#   1. Group records into unique sites by environment, subject (if present),
#      landmark, location, LTR, and orientation.
#
#   2. For each unique site, calculate multiplicity and stash records in the
#      group for later.
#
#   3. Sort sites by landmark, location, and LTR.
#
#   4. Clump sites together which are from opposite LTRs and Â±6bp.  A site which
#      could belong to more than one clump is put in the first matching clump.
#
#   5. For the "best" site from each clump, output the original input records from
#      step 1.  The "best" site is the one with the highest multiplicity (to
#      preserve the most input records).  Ties are broken by choosing the site
#      with the earliest location.
#
# Look at the Makefiles in the NCI-RID and Sunshine-2016-JVI sources to see
# examples of this filter in use.
#
# All arguments are passed to bin/clump-dual-ltr-records.
