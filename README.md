# ISDB is an open-source software toolkit for building databases of proviral integration sites.

Using ISDB, you can curate a private database from any heterogenous set of data
sources, including previously-published datasets and internal, work-in-progress
data.  To make data visible and accessible to collaborators with varying
degrees of computational expertise, ISDB automatically generates web sites
describing database contents and data exports in several common formats.

As distinct from a public depository database, the ability to build local,
private databases makes ISDB suitable for use in testing hypotheses and
developing analyses in the long pre-publication phase of most research.  The
goal of ISDB is to provide a standard end-to-end platform for reliably storing,
performing reproducible analyses on, and ultimately publishing integration site
data.

We developed ISDB to support our research into the locations of HIV-1 proviral
integrations in patients on suppressive ART. It helps us __durably store and
reliably manage the data we generate__ and provides __a standard platform for
our analyses across datasets__.

[HIRIS][], our HIV-1 Reservoirs Integration Sites database, is built and
published using ISDB.
